# My attempt to answer the extra questions in the lab 3.1
# Andrew Scott

# Added code as a comment so python wont run it and return an error
# Below code won't work as it's trying to combine int to strings
# message = 'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'
# print(message)

# To fix it, add quotes around the int to make it a string

message = 'I have eaten ' + "99" + ' burritos.'
print(message)

# eggs can be used as a variable name as it is not predefined by python, whereas 100 is predefined with the literal
# numerical value of 100, so it makes no sense to try assign it a different value

# The three functions are int(), float(), and str()
